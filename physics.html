    <h2>CLAS at JLab</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="fullcolumn">
        <p>During two summers of my undergraduate study, I worked in the Student Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program at Argonne National Laboratory.
        There, I worked on data analysis and simulation for an experiment that had run with the CLAS detector at Thomas Jefferson National Lab (JLab) in Virginia.
    </p></div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>The CLAS detector is a large acceptance spectrometer in Hall B of the Continuous Electron Beam Facility (CEBAF) at JLab, measuring final-state particles from fixed-target collisions by the electron beam.
            The specific experiment I worked in used 1 and 6 GeV polarized electron beams on a hydrogen and helium fixed targets, 
            with a time-projection chamber around the target that measured the recoiling nucleus
            In the first summer, I worked on running the Geant4 simulation package to simulate particles traversing the central detector.
             One interesting section of this project was when I wrote my own simulation, using the same equations as Geant4, of the energy loss for particles, which helped
             me discover that the existing simulation setup had a critical error where the density of the target gas was several orders of magnitude too large (due to an issue with units), 
             leading to particles losing too much energy in the simulation.

        <div class="fullcolumn">
        <p>In the second summer I worked on analyzing data from both hydrogen and helium targets with 1.1 GeV electron.
            I analyzed the electrons measured by the detector and compared to predictions based on elastic scattering to estimate the efficiency of the detector.

    <h3>Direct Contributions</h3>

    <h4>Jet-Hadron Paper</h4>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="fullcolumn">
    <p>
        Some of my first physics work in graduate school was contributing to an analysis of jet-hadron correlations in Pb-Pb collisions.
        The purpose of this analysis was to study how jets (clusters of quarks and gluons originating from a single high energy quark or gluon) lose energy
        in the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. 
    </p>

    <p> In addition to contributing ideas for variables to measure for the final result, my main contribution was to produce a theoretical prediction to compare to.
        I did this using the JEWEL model (details here <a href="https://jewel.hepforge.org/">here</a>), a Monte Carlo event generator for jets losing energy in a quark-gluon plasma.
        In order to create predictions with statistical significance, I had to run large batches of simulations with the model, on the order of 100 million events.
        To do this, I learned how to use the high performance computing resources available at Yale, including using the SLURM and TORQUE computing clusture software.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the process of studying results for JEWEL, I uncovered a surprising bug that resulted in strange, asymmetric results in one of the two main modes of JEWEL. 
        After learning more Fortran, I was able to identify the cause of the bug and figure out a simple fix, which is now included in the model. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I was succesfully able to produce predictions for the jet-hadron paper, which are included in final publication, available <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/736/1/012021">here</a>.

    <h4>Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter Performance Paper</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>
                As a gradute student member of the ALICE collaboration, I worked on one of the subdetectors of ALICE, the EMCal (Electromagnetic-Calorimeter).
                Specifically, I worked on updating and tuning the simulation of the EMCal trigger (a feature of the detector that lets us oversample rare events of interest).
                My work consisted of updating the simulation to include a new section of the detector added for the 2015-2018 run of the LHC and to add artificial noise to the simulation to mimic the real noise.
                This work helped with my own analysis and was included in the larger publication on the performance of the EMCal, available <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/18/08/P08007">here</a>.

    <h4>My Analysis</h4>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="fullcolumn">
            <p>I will add more details here in the near future.</p>


            <p>My full thesis is available at this <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2819867">link</a>.</p>

                After completing my Ph.D analysis on the 2015 data set, I worked on extending my analysis to use a new reconstruction of the 2015 data and include additional data taken in 2018.
                In the process, I found the cause of a bug that caused a strange feature in the data.
                Unfortunately, this bug affected my Ph.D analysis and reduced any effect that could be found by a factor of 5.
                On the bright side, with this bug fixed, my analysis has been approved as a paper proposal within the collaboration.
