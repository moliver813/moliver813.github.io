    <h2>CLAS at JLab</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="fullcolumn">
        <p>During two summers of my undergraduate study, I worked in the Student Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program at Argonne National Laboratory.
        There, I worked on data analysis and simulation for an experiment that had run with the CLAS detector at Thomas Jefferson National Lab (JLab) in Virginia.

        <div class="column">
            <p>The CLAS detector is a large acceptance spectrometer in Hall B of the Continuous Electron Beam Facility (CEBAF) at JLab, measuring final-state particles from fixed-target collisions by the electron beam.
            The specific experiment I worked in used 1 and 6 GeV polarized electron beams on a hydrogen and helium fixed targets, 
            with a time-projection chamber around the target that measured the recoiling nucleus
            In the first summer, I worked on running the Geant4 simulation package to simulate particles traversing the central detector.
             One interesting section of this project was when I wrote my own simulation, using the same equations as Geant4, of the energy loss for particles, which helped
             me discover that the existing simulation setup had a critical error where the density of the target gas was several orders of magnitude too large (due to an issue with units), 
             leading to particles losing too much energy in the simulation.
