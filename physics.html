        <p>During two summers of my undergraduate study, I worked in the Student Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program at Argonne National Laboratory.
        There, I worked on data analysis and simulation for an experiment that had run with the CLAS detector at Thomas Jefferson National Lab (JLab) in Virginia.

        <div class="twothirdscolumn">
            <p>The CLAS detector was a large acceptance spectrometer in Hall B of the Continuous Electron Beam Facility (CEBAF) at JLab, measuring final-state particles from fixed-target collisions by the electron beam.
